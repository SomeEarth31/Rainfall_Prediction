# Rainfall_Prediction
A basic Rainfall Prediction Model

I believe in free-to-use open-source code, so feel free to use any of them as a template. I apologise if the code is not easy to read or if it doesn't follow the correct conventions. This was just created as part of a project to learn the basics of predictive models. Three files are attached; one is a jupyter notebook for the model, the other uses a grid search to find the correct hyperparameters, and the last is the dataset.
